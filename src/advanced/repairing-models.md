% Repairing Models

If the 3D mesh described in the model contains holes, or edges are
misaligned (known as being non-manifold), then Slic3r may have problems
working on it. Slic3r will attempt to fix any problems it can, but some
problems are out of its reach. If the application complains that a model
cannot be sliced correctly then there are several options available, and
the ones described here are all free at the time of writing.

#### Netfabb Studio

Netfabb produce a range of 3D modelling
applications, including a free basic version[^1]. This version includes
a mesh repair module which can help eliminate the various problems
faced. Up-to-date instructions can be found on the Netfabb wiki[^2]; the
following is a quick overview of the steps involved.

 ![Netfabb Studio: Part
repair.](images/repair/netfabb_studio_part_repair.png "fig:")


-   Start Netfabb Studio, and load the problem STL file, either via the
    `File` menu or by dragging and dropping it onto the workspace. If
    Netfabb detects a problem it will show a red warning sign in the
    bottom right-hand corner.

-   To run the repair scripts, select the part and then either click the
    first aid icon in the toolbar (the red cross), or select from the
    context menu `Extras` -> `Repair Part`. This will open the part repair
    tab and show the status of the model.

-   The `Actions` and the `Repair scripts` tabs offer several repair
    scripts, which can be applied manually. However for the purposes of
    this overview selecting the `Automatic repair` script will fix most
    problems.

-   The automatic repair button presents two options: Default and
    Simple. Choosing Default will cover most cases. Select `execute` to
    run the scripts.

-   Once the part is repaired the repairs must be applied by selecting
    `Apply repair`, choosing whether to override the existing part or
    not.

-   The part may then be exported by selecting `Export part` -> `As STL`
    from the context menu.

-   If Netfabb still detects that the exported part will still contain
    errors then it will provide the option to apply further repairs
    before exporting.

#### Netfabb Cloud Service

Netfabb also hosts a web service where an
STL file may be uploaded for it to be checked and repaired[^3].

 ![Netfabb Cloud
Services.](images/repair/netfabb_cloud_services.png "fig:")


-   Navigate to http://cloud.netfabb.com

-   Choose the STL file to upload using the button provided.

-   An email address must be given to inform you when the service is finished.

-   Choose whether metric or imperial measurements should be used.

-   Read and accept the terms of service, and then click `Upload to Cloud`.

-   Once the service has analysed and repaired the file an email is sent
    providing the download link to the repaired file.

#### FreeCAD

Freecad[^4] is a comprehensive, and free, CAD program that comes with a
mesh module, in which repairs to degenerate models can be made. the
following steps outline how a problem model file can be analysed and
repaired.

 ![FreeCAD part
repair.](images/repair/freecad_part_repair.png "fig:")


-   Start FreeCAD and from the start splash page choose `Working with Meshes`.

-   Load the model by dragging and dropping it onto the workspace or via
    the `File` menu. A small message in the bottom left corner will
    indicate if the model appears to have problems.

-   From the menu choose `Meshes` -> `Analyze` -> `Evaluate & Repair mesh` to
    bring up the repair options dialog.

-   From the options dialog choose the loaded mesh, then perform each
    analysis by clicking the `Analyze` button by each problem type, or
    select `Repetitive Repair` at the bottom to perform all checks. If a
    corresponding problem is detected the `Repair` button becomes
    enabled.

-   For each desired repair hit the `Repair` button.

-   It is important to review the effect the repair script has made to
    the model. It may be the case that the script damages the file,
    rather than repairit, for example by removing important triangles.

-   Export the repaired model via the `Export` menu option or context menu.
