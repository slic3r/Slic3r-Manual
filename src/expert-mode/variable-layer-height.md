% Variable Layer Height

  - min / max layer height settings per extruder

- Left click: quadratic manipulator
- right click: linear manipulator


Slic3r gives the ability to adjust the layer height along the Z axis.
That is, parts of the model could be printed
with a coarse layer height, for example vertical sections, and other
parts could be printed with a finer layer height, for example sloping
gradients where layering appears more pronounced.

The layer thickness distribution can be influenced by:

- automatic pre-computing of good thicknesses with [Adaptive Slicing](#adaptive-slicing)
- interactive refinement in the [Adaptive Layers](#interactive-layer-refinement) settings tab
- setting a fixed layer height for a particular range in the [Layer height table](#static-layer-height-table) setting tab

Adaptive Slicing {#adaptive-slicing}
----------------

Maintaining a good balance between printing time and quality is a fundamental
trade-off problem for 3D printing.

If the `Use adaptive slicing` option is enabled, Slic3r automatically
computes the individual thickness of each layer based on the angle of the surface.
Technical details are provided in a paper [^1].

The `Adaptive quality` option adjusts the overall quality between 0% - thickest
printable layers over the entire object to 100% - thinnest possible layers.

The `Z full steps/mm` parameter is always respected by the adaptive slicing
process, also the `Combine infill` logic is not affected.
Example: if `Combine infill` is set to 3, Slic3r will combine up to 3 infill
layers, even if those layers are of different thickness. The number of combined
layers will vary along the Z axis, depending on the local thickness of layers.

Upper and lower limits for the layer thickness are set per extruder in the
`Printer Settings` tab. Slic3r automatically uses the values for all extruders
which are used for a particular print. If for example only one extruder is used
from a dual nozzle printer, the limits of the second extruder won't reduce the
maximum layer thickness.

Interactive Layer Refinement {#interactive-layer-refinement}
----------------

A tool to interactively refine the layer heights of an object is available by
double clicking an object in the 3D tab or taking the `Layer heights...`
short-cut on the Plater. This opens `Adaptive Layers` tab in the Settings
dialogue, where the layer thickness curve can be modified for each individual
model on the plater.

Static Layer Height Table {#static-layer-height-table}
----------------

The layer height table allows to define a layer height for a particular
range along the Z axis, given in millimeters.
The values from this table will override both, the default and adaptively
generated layer heights, but not the interactively modified curve in the
`Adaptive layers` tab.

In this example the steepest base of the model is printed at 0.4mm, the steeper
parts of the roof are printed at 0.2mm, and the less steep at 0.15mm. Note that
each range divides exactly by the given layer height so there are no "gaps"
between sections.
