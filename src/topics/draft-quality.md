% Draft Quality

Several options can be disabled or tuned in order to achieve faster G-code
generation speed and shorter print times.

### Print Settings > Layers and perimeters > Quality

![Quality options](images/draft_quality_options.png)

These options provide nicer and cleaner objects but require more CPU time. They
can be disabled for draft quality prints.

* `Extra perimeters if needed` &ndash; this feature checks whether adding more
  perimeters to sloping layers would help hiding the internal infill, thus make
  the object look nicer.
* `Avoid crossing perimeters`&ndash; this feature blends travel moves so that the
  nozzle stays fully inside or outside the object whenever possible, thus
  reducing the number of times it crosses perimeters and triggers a retraction.
  This prevents stringing but requires more CPU time during G-code export because
  complex motion planning algorithms are used for each single layer, and
  potentially longer print times as the nozzle may not be able to always take the
  most direct path when traveling.
* `Detect thin walls` &ndash; this feature checks for collisions between
  perimeters. It ensures that the printer doesn't try to extrude too close
  paths, and uses the medial axis algorithm in order to transform thin walls
  into single-pass extrusions.
* `Detect bridging perimeters` &ndash; this feature detects the
  bridging/overhanging portions of perimeters and applies bridge flow/speed to
  them.

### Print Settings > Infill

The *Hilbert Curve*, *Archimedean Chords* and *Octagram Spiral* infill patterns
are generally much slower. You might want to avoid them in your draft quality
prints if you care about slicing speed.

### Print Settings > Advanced > Resolution

By default, Slic3r does not simplify the input geometry and will render all
details into the output G-code for maximum accuracy. However, high-resolution
models often carry more resolution than the printer is able to print, so they
can be simplified especially when you want faster slicing. You can set the
*Resolution* option to something like 0.05mm or even 0.1mm for your draft
quality prints.

### Print settings > Advanced > Threads

(This hint applies to all kind of prints, not just draft quality.) Many
algorithms in Slic3r support parallelization using multiple threads. You should
set this option to the number of processors or cores of your computer.
