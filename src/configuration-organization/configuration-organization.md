% Configuration Organization

Profiles
========

Configuration in Slic3r is organized across three categories:

* **Printer Settings** &ndash; these options define capabilities of the
  printer(s). You rarely need to change these option after the initial setup of
  a new printer.
* **Filament Settings** &ndash; these options define filament-specific
  properties, such as diameter, temperatures and cooling.
* **Print Settings** &ndash; these options define the "build styles" that you can
  use for each print. For example you might want to have distinct profiles for
  vases, mechanical objects, high quality models, drafts and so on.

From the main view (the plater) you can quickly select the profiles you want to use for printing: a printer, a filament and a print style.

Creating Profiles
-----------------

Open the desired tab and change the settings as necessary. Once
satisfied, click the save icon to the left above the setting titles, and
give a suitable name when prompted.

Profiles can be deleted by choosing the profile to delete and clicking
the red delete button next to the save button.

Exporting and Importing
=======================

If you want to transfer your settings to another computer, or send them via
e-mail, or store them along with your models, you can use the `Export Config...`
command in the File menu. This will save all the values of the currently
selected presets into a text file having a `.ini` extension. These files can be
easily loaded back with the `Load Config...` command.

Note that loading a config file doesn't store it as a preset automatically, so it
will be not remembered the next time you launch Slic3r. If you want to store it
you'll have to go through the *Print Settings*, *Filament Settings* and *Printer
Settings* sections and hit the "Save" button for each section you want to create
a preset in.

The `Export Config Bundle...` allows the user to export the **entire** set of
profiles to a single file (not just the selected profiles). This is handy if you
want to clone a Slic3r setup from one computer to another, or make a backup.

Import Configuration from G-Code
-------------------------------

If you want to use the same settings/configuration from model B in your model A,
you can do so by simply importing the G-Code-file from model B. In `File` choose
`Import Config from GCode-File...` and select your previously saved GCode (model
B) file.

When you click `OK` on your model B, a new `.ini` file will be created in the
same directory as your model B. It's named just like your model B:
`<name-of-model-B>.ini`. After the file has been created, it will automatically
be imported in Slic3r. This `.ini` file holds your settings and could also be
shared with others without revealing your C-Gode.

Note that this only works for G-Code files which were sliced using Slic3r. Also,
these settings are not stored in Slic3r unless you explicity create profiles for
them.

Using a Custom Data Directory
=============================

By default, Slic3r stores its settings and profiles into a system directory,
which depends on the operating system. Users are not supposed to touch such
application preferences directories, so they're chosen automatically. However,
Slic3r has a `--datadir` command line option that allows the user to set a custom
directory. This can be useful for several customizations, such as keeping
multiple Slic3r copies on a single computer, or for sharing configuration files
across network.

Sharing Configuration across Network
------------------------------------

If you have a network-mounted device you can simply launch Slic3r with the `--datadir` option pointing to the custom directory, for example:

```
slic3r.exe --datadir Z:\Slic3r-settings
```

On Linux and MacOS X you have another option instead of using `--datadir`: a
link to the shared directory can be created where Slic3r looks for the default
directory. This can used for example for synchronizing Slic3r presets using
Dropbox. The first step is to find the path where Slic3r looks for its
configuration:

```
$ /Applications/Slic3r.app/Contents/MacOS/slic3r --debug
wxWidgets version wxWidgets 2.9.4, Wx version 0.9922
Data directory: /Users/al/Library/Application Support/Slic3r
```

Now, after closing Slic3r, we move this directory to our shared folder:

```
mv "/Users/al/Library/Application Support/Slic3r" ~/Dropbox/Slic3r-settings
```

(Double quotes are needed because of the space in the path, but if you're doing
this you should already know how to work with the terminal.)

And finally we create a symbolic link:

```
ln -s ~/Dropbox/Slic3r-settings "/Users/al/Library/Application Support/Slic3r"
```

Using another Color-Scheme
==========================

Simple Usage
------------

To use another color scheme, you can switch from the default to Solarized
(by Ethan Schoonover: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). Go to `File`
-> `Preferences` -> `Color Scheme` and choose `Solarized` (or change back
to the default colors). Click `OK` and restart Slic3r.

All viewport colors have been changed to a reduced brighness contrast.

Advanced Usage
--------------

Take a look at the files `./lib/Slic3r/GUI/ColorScheme.pm` and
`./lib/Slic3r/GUI/Preferences.pm` in the `colorscheme`-section for comments on
how to create your own color-scheme or to change the colors.
