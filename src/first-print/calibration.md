% Calibration

Before even attempting the first print it is vital that the printer is
correctly calibrated. Skipping or rushing this step will result in
frustration and failed prints later, so it is important to take the time
to make sure the machine is correctly set up.

Each machine may have its own calibration procedure and this manual
will not attempt to cover all the variations. Instead here is a list of
key points that should be addressed.

-   Frame is stable and correctly aligned.

-   Belts are taut.

-   Bed is level in relation to the path of the extruder.

-   Filament rolls freely from the spool, without causing too much
    tension on the extruder.

-   Current for stepper motors is set to the correct level.

-   Firmware settings are correct including: axis movement speeds and
    acceleration; temperature control; end-stops; motor directions.

-   Extruder is calibrated in the firmware with the correct steps per mm
    of filament.

The point regarding the extruder step rate is vital. Slic3r expects that
the machine will accurately produce a set amount of filament when told
to do so. Too much will result in blobs and other imperfections in the
print. Too little will result in gaps and poor inter-layer adhesion.

Please refer to the printer documentation and/or resources in the 3D
printing community for details on how best to calibrate a particular
machine.
