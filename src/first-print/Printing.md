% Printing

At this stage Slic3r has been configured and a model has been acquired,
sliced and made ready for print. Now would be the time to fire up the
printer and try it out.

A variety of host software is available to send the G-code to the
printer. Amongst the open-source solutions are: Printrun[^1],
Repetier[^2] and Repsnapper[^3].

The following sections will cover the options available in expert mode,
and look at advanced printing techniques, including special cases and
troubleshooting.
